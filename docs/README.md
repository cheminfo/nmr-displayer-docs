# User manual

The software __NMR Displayer__ allows NMR users to import their NMR spectra, process the raw spectra, and edit the spectra.

The following screen (figure 1) appears, divided into three parts: the main menu on the left side of the screen, a working area in the middle of the screen, and an information area to the right side of the spectrum.

Figure 1: start screen

The main menu on the left side of the screen contains general information about the program, including sample spectra and simple exercises. The work area is in the middle area  where the current spectrum is displayed. The spectrum information area is on the right side of the screen. 
To hide the main menu, click on the three white bars on the right side of the blue box (figure 2). A narrow blue bar on the left side of the screen is then displayed, with the three white bars at the top. If you click on them again, the complete menu opens again. 
It is also possible to hide the main menu on the left side and work in full screen mode (figure 3). To do this, click on the __Full Screen Mode__ icon, which is located on the top right of the screen above the right information area. 
To exit the full screen mode, you can either press __esc__ on the keyboard or the right mouse button. A new, small window appears in which __Exit full screen__ must be clicked with the left mouse button.
